            <p>In 1987, Jordan Belfort lands a job as a Wall Street stockbroker for L.F. Rothschild, employed under Mark
                Hanna. He is quickly enticed into the sex- and drug-fueled stockbroker culture and Hanna’s belief that a
                broker's only goal is to make money for himself. Jordan loses his job following Black Monday, the
                largest one-day stock market drop in history, and takes a job at a boiler room brokerage firm on Long
                Island that specializes in penny stocks. Thanks to his aggressive pitching style and the high
                commissions, Jordan makes a small fortune.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Jordan befriends his neighbor Donnie Azoff, and the two found their own company. They recruit several of
                Jordan's friends, whom Jordan trains in the art of the "hard sell". Jordan's tactics and salesmanship
                largely contribute to the success of his pump and dump scheme, which involves inflating the price of a
                stock through issuing misleading, positive statements in order to sell it at an artificially augmented
                price. When the perpetrators of the scheme sell their overvalued securities, the price drops immensely
                and those who were conned into buying at the inflated price are left with stock that is suddenly worth
                much less than what they paid. To cloak this, Jordan gives the firm the respectable-sounding name
                Stratton Oakmont in 1989.</p>
                <br>
            <p>After an exposé in Forbes, hundreds of ambitious young financiers flock to his company. Jordan becomes
                immensely successful and slides into a decadent lifestyle of prostitutes and drugs. He has an affair
                with a woman named Naomi Lapaglia; when his wife finds out, Jordan divorces her and marries Naomi in
                1991. Meanwhile, the SEC and the FBI begin investigating Stratton Oakmont.</p>
                <br>
            <p>In 1993, Jordan illegally makes $22 million in three hours upon securing the IPO of Steve Madden. This
                brings him and his firm further to the attention of the FBI. To hide his money, Jordan opens a Swiss
                bank account with corrupt banker Jean-Jacques Saurel in the name of Naomi's Aunt Emma, who is a British
                national and thus outside the reach of American authorities. He uses the wife and in-laws of his friend
                Brad Bodnick, who have European passports, to smuggle the cash into Switzerland.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Donnie and Brad get into a public brawl; Donnie escapes, but Brad is arrested. Brad does not say a word
                about Donnie or Jordan to the police. Jordan learns from his private investigator that the FBI is
                wiretapping his phones. Fearing for his son, Jordan's father advises him to leave Stratton Oakmont and
                lie low while Jordan's lawyer negotiates a deal to keep him out of prison. Jordan, however, cannot bear
                to quit and talks himself into staying in the middle of his farewell speech. In 1996, Jordan, Donnie and
                their wives are on a yacht trip to Italy when they learn that Aunt Emma has died of a heart attack.
                Jordan decides to travel to Switzerland immediately to settle the bank account. To bypass border
                controls, he orders his yacht captain to sail to Monaco, but the ship capsizes in a storm. After their
                rescue, the plane sent to take them to Geneva is destroyed when a seagull flies into the engine; Jordan
                takes this as a sign from God and decides to sober up.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Two years later, the FBI arrests Jordan because Saurel, arrested in Florida on an unrelated charge, has
                informed the FBI on Jordan. Since the evidence against him is overwhelming, Jordan agrees to gather
                evidence on his colleagues in exchange for leniency. At home, Naomi tells Jordan she is divorcing him
                and wants full custody of their daughter and infant son; in an impulsive, cocaine-fueled rage, Jordan
                assaults Naomi and tries to drive away with his daughter before crashing his car in the driveway. Later
                on, Jordan wears a wire to work but slips a note to Donnie, warning him. The FBI discovers this, arrests
                Jordan, and raids and shuts down Stratton Oakmont. Despite breaching his deal, Jordan receives a reduced
                sentence of 36 months in a minimum security prison for his testimony, and is released after serving 22
                months. After his release, Jordan makes a living hosting seminars on sales technique.</p>
